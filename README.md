# ntm-td-dev-tagopbrowser
 An opBrowser that allows tagging of a single scoped op
 
 A new column has been added to opBrowser and a field widget bound to the parameter Scopedtag.
 By filling scoped tag you will be shown which ops have the tag ( green ) and which do not ( red ).
 Clikcing the color will "toggle" the op to have that tag or not.
 
 Useful for going through a system and adding specific tags to do tag based operations via findChildren or opfind.
